.SH DESCRIPTION

displays GIF image files on workstations and terminals running the X Window
System.
.B gifview
understands multi-image GIFs, which can be displayed either as slideshows
or as animations.

only useful for multi-image GIFs.

.PP
Left-clicking on a window goes to the next frame; right-clicking on a

'
.SH COMMAND LINE

.BR gifview 's
command line consists of
.IR "GIF input files" 
and
.IR options .
Most options start with a dash (\-) or plus (+); frame selections, a kind
of option, start with a number sign (#). Anything else is a GIF input file.
.PP
.B gifview
displays one window for each GIF input file you specify. If no GIF input
file is given, or you give the special filename `\-', it reads from the
standard input.
'
.SH OPTIONS

.PD 0
.TP 5
.OP \-\-animate ", " \-a
'
Causes multi-image GIFs to appear as animations. Normally, multi-image GIFs
first appear in slideshow mode. You can always use the
.RB ` s '
keystroke to toggle between modes. This option has a converse,
.QO \-\-no\-animate
or
.QO +a .
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OP \-\-unoptimize ", " \-U
'
Unoptimizes multi-image GIFs before display, creating a complete
representation of what a user will see at each frame of an animation. See
.BR gifsicle (1)
for a more detailed description of unoptimization. This option has a
converse,
.QO \-\-no\-unoptimize
or
.QO +U .
GIFs are always displayed unoptimized in animation mode.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OA \-\-display display
'
Sets the X display to
.IR display .
This option must come before any GIF files to be read.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OA \-\-name name
'
Specifies the application name under which resources are found, rather than
the default of ``gifview''. Since
.B gifview
itself does not use the resource database, this is mostly useful for
communication with your window manager.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OA \-\-geometry geometry
'
This standard X option specifies the preferred size and position for
.BR gifview 's
windows. At most one
.OP \-\-geometry
option can be given per window (that is, per input GIF file).

.TP 5
.OP \-\-help
'
Prints usage information and exits.

.SS Frame Selections

A frame selection tells
.B gifview
which frames to display from the current input file. They are useful only
for animations, as non-animated GIFs only have one frame. Frame selections
can only be displayed in slideshow mode. Here are the legal forms for frame
specifications.
.Sp
.PD 0
.TP 13
.BI # num
'
Select frame \fInum\fR. (The first frame is
.QO #0 .
Negative numbers count backwards from the last frame, which is
.QO #-1 .)

Select frames \fInum1\fR through \fInum2\fR.
