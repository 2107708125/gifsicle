\%[\fB--display\fP \fIdisplay\fP]
\%[options]
\%[filenames and frames].\|.\|.
'
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gifview
displays GIF image files on workstations and terminals running the X Window
System.
.B gifview
understands multi-image GIFs, which can be displayed either as slideshows
or as animations.
'
.SH INTERACTION
.B gifsicle
windows recognize several keystrokes and button commands. Many of them are
only useful for multi-image GIFs.
.TP 12
Space
'
Go to the next frame.
.TP
.B b
Go to the previous frame.
.TP
.BR r " or " <
Go to the first frame.
.TP
.BR >
Go to the last frame.
.TP

.TP
.BR s " or " a
Toggle between animation and slideshow mode.
.TP
Backspace
'
Delete this window.
.TP
.B q

.BR gifview .
'
.PP
Left-clicking on a window goes to the next frame; right-clicking on a
window deletes that window.
'
.SH COMMAND LINE

.BR gifview 's
command line consists of
.IR "GIF input files" 
and
.IR options .
Most options start with a dash (\-) or plus (+); frame selections, a kind
of option, start with a number sign (#). Anything else is a GIF input file.
.PP
.B gifview
displays one window for each GIF input file you specify. If no GIF input
file is given, or you give the special filename `\-', it reads from the
standard input.
'
.SH OPTIONS

.PD 0
.TP 5
.OP \-\-animate ", " \-a
'
Animate multi-image GIFs by default. Normally, multi-image GIFs first
appear in slideshow mode. You can always use the
.RB ` a '
keystroke to toggle between modes. This option has a converse,
.QO \-\-no\-animate
or
.QO +a .
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OP \-\-unoptimize ", " \-U
'
Unoptimize multi-image GIFs before display, creating a complete
representation of what a user will see at each frame of an animation. See
.BR gifsicle (1)
for a more detailed description of unoptimization. This option has a
converse,
.QO \-\-no\-unoptimize
or
.QO +U .
GIFs are always displayed unoptimized in animation mode. Some complex GIFs
cannot be unoptimized.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OA \-d display
.TP
.OA \-\-display display
'
Sets the X display to
.IR display .
This option must come before any GIF files.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OA \-\-name name
'
Sets the application name under which resources are found, rather than
the default of ``gifview''. Since
.B gifview
itself does not use the resource database, this is mostly useful for
communication with your window manager.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OA \-\-geometry geometry
'
Set the size and position of
.BR gifview 's
windows. This is a standard X option. At most one
.OP \-\-geometry
option can be given per window (that is, per input GIF file).
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OA \-w window
.TP
.OA \-\-window window
'
Display the next GIF input in an existing X window, instead of making a new
top-level window. With this option, you can use
.B gifview
to display animated GIFs in a window you created with another program.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OP \-\-install\-colormap ", " \-i
'
Use a private colormap for each window (if you are using a PseudoColor
display). This avoids polluting the existing colormap, and may produce
better results if your colormap is full, but causes annoying colormap
flashing.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OP \-\-no\-interactive ", " \+e
'
Don't pay attention to mouse buttons or keystrokes.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.OP \-\-help
'
Print usage information and exit.
'
.Sp
.TP
.OP \-\-version
'
Print the version number and some quickie warranty information and exit.

.SS Frame Selections

A frame selection tells
.B gifview
which frames to display from the current input file. They are useful only
for animations, as non-animated GIFs only have one frame. Frame selections
can only be displayed in slideshow mode. Here are the legal forms for frame
specifications.
.Sp
.PD 0
.TP 13
.BI # num
'
Select frame \fInum\fR. (The first frame is
.QO #0 .
Negative numbers count backwards from the last frame, which is
.QO #-1 .)
'
.TP 13
.BI # num1 \- num2
'
Select frames \fInum1\fR through \fInum2\fR.
'
.TP 13
.BI # num1 \-
'
Select frames \fInum1\fR through the last frame.
'
.TP 13
.BI # name
'
Select the frame named \fIname\fR.
