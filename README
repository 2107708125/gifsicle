GIFSICLE 1.2
============

ABOUT GIFSICLE
--------------
   Gifsicle twaddles GIF image files in a variety of ways. It is better
than many of the freely available GIF twaddlers on the market -- for one
thing, it has more options.

   It supports merging several GIFs into a GIF animation; exploding an
animation into its component frames; changing individual frames in an
animation; turning interlacing on and off; adding transparency; adding
delays, disposals, and the Netscape loop extension to animations; adding
and removing comments; optimizing animations for space; and changing
images' colormaps, among other things. Extensive command-line options
control which, if any, of these occur.

   Please see the man page, `gifsicle.man', for more information.

   Gifsicle comes with NO WARRANTY, express or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.

MAKING GIFSICLE
---------------
   You need an ANSI C compiler, such as gcc.

   Just type `./configure', then `make'. `make install' will build and
install gifsicle and its manual page.

   `./configure' accepts the usual options. See `INSTALL' for more
details.

   If you have X11, you can additionally build a simple program,
`gifview', which shows the frames of its input GIFs in an X window.
Click on the window to move to the next frame. Gifview is an alpha
program and is not built by default. To build gifview, give
`./configure' the `--enable-gifview' option.

BUGS, SUGGESTIONS, ETC.
-----------------------
   Please write me if you have trouble building or running gifsicle, or if
you have suggestions or (preferably) patches. Also write to this address to
get on a (spam-free) Gifsicle mailing list.

   1. Unisys Corp. holds a patent on the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression
algorithm used by GIF images. When this first became an issue several years
ago, Unisys put up a statement on their page stating that programs
available at no cost to the user, like Gifsicle, could use LZW compression
in the context of GIF images without obtaining a license. If you plan to
distribute GIF writing code in a shareware or commercial product, you will
need to worry about obtaining a license.

   2. Developers or distributors who plan to use Gifsicle code, whole or
in part, in a product whose source code will not be made available to the
end user, MUST contact the author and obtain permission before doing so.
