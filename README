GIFSICLE 1.3
============

ABOUT GIFSICLE
--------------
   Gifsicle twaddles GIF image files in a variety of ways. It is better
than many of the freely available GIF twaddlers on the market -- for one
thing, it has more options.

   It supports merging several GIFs into a GIF animation; exploding an
animation into its component frames; changing individual frames in an
animation; turning interlacing on and off; adding transparency; adding
delays, disposals, and looping to animations; adding or removing comments;
flipping and rotation; optimizing animations for space; and changing
images' colormaps, among other things. Extensive command-line options
control which, if any, of these occur.

   Please see the man page, `gifsicle.man', for more information.

   Gifview, a companion program requiring X11, displays GIF images and
animations on an X display. It can display multi-frame GIFs either as
slideshows, displaying one frame at a time, or as real-time animations.
Note that you must give `./configure' the `--enable-gifview' option to
build gifview. See its man page, `gifview.man', for more information.

   Gifdiff, another companion program not built by default, checks two
GIF files for identical visual appearance. (This is probably not useful
unless you're testing GIF-manipulating software.) See its man page,
`gifdiff.man', for more information.

   The Gifsicle package comes with NO WARRANTY, express or implied,
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability
and fitness for a particular purpose.

MAKING GIFSICLE
---------------
   You need an ANSI C compiler, such as gcc.

   Just type `./configure', then `make'. `make install' will build and
install gifsicle and its manual page (under /usr/local by default).

   `./configure' accepts the usual options. See `INSTALL' for more
details.

   To build gifview also, give `./configure' the `--enable-gifview' option.
To build gifdiff, give the `--enable-gifdiff' option.

CHANGES SINCE 1.2
-----------------
   More significant optimizer improvements. Also added flipping, rotation,
and gifdiff.

CHANGES SINCE 1.1
-----------------
   The optimizer has been greatly improved. Colormap shrinking and
assignment is now available (see --colors and related options). Several
memory leaks were plugged, making gifsicle and gifview usable even on
massive GIFs. Several bug fixes: no more segmentation faults on erroneous
inputs, and local colormaps are no longer corrupted. Gifview is out of
beta, and is now fully functional. The man page should be more readable.
See `NEWS' in this directory for a more detailed listing.

BUGS, SUGGESTIONS, ETC.

you have suggestions or patches. Also write to this address to get on a

   1. Unisys Corp. holds a patent on the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression
algorithm used by GIF images. When this first became an issue several years
ago, Unisys stated that programs available at no cost to the user, like
Gifsicle, could use LZW compression in the context of GIF images without
obtaining a license. If you plan to distribute GIF writing code in a
shareware or commercial product, you will need to worry about obtaining a
license.

   2. Developers or distributors who plan to use Gifsicle code, whole or in
part, in a product whose source code will not be made available to the end
user -- in other words, in a context which would violate the GPL -- MUST
contact the author and obtain permission before doing so.
