Version 1.2b6

* License clarification in README.

* GIF comments are now printed out more carefully in --info: binary characters
  appear as backslash escapes. (Literal backslashes are printed as `\\'.)

* New --extension-info/--einfo option.

* Removed spurious warning about local colormaps when a --colors option is in
  effect.

* Replacing a named frame with another image now keeps the name by default.


Version 1.2b5	12.May.1998

* Longstanding bug fix in gifunopt.c: an interlaced replacement frame
  caused strange behavior when later optimizing, as the underlying data
  wasn't deinterlaced.

* Further improvements in optimizer; specifically, -O2 works better now --
  it uses actual image data to look for an unused pixel value when
  there's no transparency specified.


Version 1.2b4	12.May.1998

* Improved --optimize's performance on images where successive frames had
  different transparent color indexes.


Version 1.2b3	11.May.1998

* Fixed bugs in --unoptimize: it would try to unoptimize images with local
  color tables and some transparency manipulations could cause a silent
  failure (example: 2 colors; frame 0 = [*11], frame 1 = [*0*], where * is
  a transparent pixel. Unoptimized, frame 1 should contain [*01] -- but this
  can't be expressed with only 2 colors.)

* Greatly improved --optimize's performance on some images by changing the
  way frames were switched to --disposal=background. Problem noticed by
  David Hedbor <david@hedbor.org>

* Documentation improvements.

* Unrecognized extensions are now passed through without change. The
  --no-extensions option (currently undocumented) removes all
  unrecognized extensions.

* Bug fix in gifview: frame selections now prevent display of entire GIF.


Version 1.2b2	9.May.1998

* Fixed bad dumb bug in gif.h: lack of parens around macro argument

* Changed heuristic for diversity algorithm: never blend if there are 3 colors
  or less

* Some optimizations to Floyd-Steinberg code


Version 1.2b1	8.May.1998

* Added colormap options: `--colors', `--color-method', `--dither', and
  `--use-colormap'. All this code is in quantize.c.

* Renamed `--color-change' to `--change-color'.


Version 1.1.2

* Added `--color-change' option.

* Added negative frame numbers. `#-N' no longer means `#0-N'; it means the
  `N'th frame from the end (where `#-1' is the last frame). You can use
  negative frame numbers in ranges as well (e.g., `#-5--1').


Version 1.1.1	22.Nov.1997

* Fixed bug in CLP which segmentation-faulted on `-' arguments.


Version 1.1	20.Nov.1997

* Added `--crop' option.

* Changed usage behavior on bad command lines.


Version 1.0	21.Jun.1997

* Added `--output/-o' option to specify output filename.

* Slight behavior change: Now, if you --replace a frame
  (say frame #2), its delay value will be preserved in the
  replacement frame, unless you give an explicit delay.
  (Before, the replacement frame's delay would be used,
  which was probably 0.) 


Version 0.91	15.Jun.1997

* Bug fix: `--optimize' didn't handle the bottom row of
  an image's changed area correctly. This could lead to
  incorrect animations.
  Specific change: merge.c line 744: was y < fbt, now y <= fbt.

* Added `-S' as synonym for `--logical-screen'. 


Version 0.9	12.Jun.1997

* The first release.

* The document http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~eddietwo/gifsicle/changes.html has
  a possibly more up-to-date list of changes.
