Version 1.2b1

* Added colormap options: `--colors', `--color-method', `--dither', and
  `--use-colormap'. All this code is in quantize.c.

* Renamed `--color-change' to `--change-color'.

Version 1.1.2

* Added `--color-change' option.

* Added negative frame numbers. `#-N' no longer means `#0-N'; it means the
  `N'th frame from the end (where `#-1' is the last frame). You can use
  negative frame numbers in ranges as well (e.g., `#-5--1').

Version 1.1.1

* Added `--crop' option.

* Changed usage behavior on bad command lines.

* Fixed bug in CLP which segmentation-faulted on `-' arguments.

Version 1.0

* Added `--output/-o' option to specify output filename.

* Slight behavior change: Now, if you --replace a frame
  (say frame #2), its delay value will be preserved in the
  replacement frame, unless you give an explicit delay.
  (Before, the replacement frame's delay would be used,
  which was probably 0.) 

Version 0.91

* Bug fix: `--optimize' didn't handle the bottom row of
  an image's changed area correctly. This could lead to
  incorrect animations.
  Specific change: merge.c line 744: was y < fbt, now y <= fbt.

* Added `-S' as synonym for `--logical-screen'. 

Version 0.9

* The first release.

* The document http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~eddietwo/gifsicle/changes.html has
  a possibly more up-to-date list of changes.
